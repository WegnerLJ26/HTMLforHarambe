			<h3 id="bio"> Mark M. Margarita: A Hero's Journey</h3>
			<p id="biotext">Mr. Mark M. Margarita was born in 1928 to a proud Pre-School teacher in Happy Valley-Goose Bay in the Canadian Territory of Newfoundland and Labrador. As a child he held the title of High School President from ages 8-18, though he never ran for office. On the day of his 18th birthday Mark left the great green lands of Canada to attend college at the prestigious University of Eastern Montana Online Institute of Music Production and Crab Fishing. He graduated as UEMOIMPCF’s valedictorian with a Bachelor’s Degree in International Talent Management. After he finished his graduation commencement speech, which he delivered entirely in Morse Code, he was picked up by helicopter by the Kim Sisters—the Kim Sisters would go on to become the first Korean artists to release an album in the US in 1959. Following the historic release of their album, Mr. Margarita decided it was time to move on. Mark M. Margarita relocated to the vibrant Amish community of Nappanee, Indiana.</p>
	<p id="biotext">Mr. Margarita lived with the Amish as a successful barn builder until 1962. This was when he packed up all of his things and took his horse and buggy to Havana, Cuba. He spent his days in Havana managing the Cuban National Baseball Team. He led them to 6 straight Caribbean Baseball Championships, defeating the Haitian National team in the championship every time.  In early 1969, Mr. Margarita grew tired of his position as Manager of the Cuban National Baseball Team. He began looking for a new life path. It was not until July 20 1969 that Mr. Margarita was inspired for his greatest venture yet.</p>
	<p id="biotext">While watching the US news on TV with his good friend Fidel Castro, he saw the United States land a man on the moon. This is all it took for Mr. Margarita to realize his life’s true purpose. While on a trip to Guatemala for a baseball game, he repelled out of his hotel window and found his way back into the Unites States. After returning to the US Mr. Margarita began his newest, greatest endeavor: a mobile Margarita Truck and website. To begin this endeavor Mr. Margarita went to the most margarita friendly place on earth: Whitewater, WI. There were some problems with this endeavor, the main one being that the internet—and by extension websites—had not yet been invented. But this is a testament to the visionary that was Mark M. Margarita. His truck continues to flourish to this day. On his deathbed on September 3rd 2016 the late, great Mark M. Margarita tasked four promising men to complete his vision by creating the website for Mark’s Margs.</p>
	<p id="biotext">This is the story of who some have called the “Hero of Our Generation” and this is the product of those young men tasked with completing his vision.</p>
